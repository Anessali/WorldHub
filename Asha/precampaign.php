            <p>Think of this as something worth reading before joining a campaign I run. It's just meant to get you an idea of what to expect.</p>

            <h2>What type of GM am I?</h2>
            <p>I'm an inexperienced GM who is always trying to improve, so you should expect that. In short, don't expect professional D&D. Do expect that I want you to have fun and am open to feedback.</p>

            <h2>What kind of game do I want to run?</h2>
            <p>While I'd like to tailor the experience to my players a little bit, my ideal campaign would be a roleplay-heavy one where choices matter and there are consequences for the player's actions. Consequences does mean that a character can end up in a situation that results in their character's death.</p>
            <p>Apart from that, I'm probably having fun if you are.</p>

            <h2>Included Themes</h2>
            <p>Since I have absolutely no idea who's going to end up playing, I thought I'd talk about included content some people may not like.</p> 
            <p>The most obvious thing to me is the racism in the setting, which is a big enough part of the setting that I'm not going to remove it. I can sympathize if I have a player who's uncomfortable with it though, so I thought I'd make it clear OOC racism is absolutely not okay and as a GM I'm going to try to have it only where it makes sense.</p>
            <p>Apart from that, I'm hoping to get an idea of what everyone's okay with and then work from there. A friend of mine showed me <a href="./data/PDF/RPG Consent Checklist.pdf">this consent sheet</a>, which I'd like my players to fill out.</p>

            <h2>Virtual Tabletop</h2>
            <p>I mostly see people using Roll20, so I felt it's worth mentioning I'm using Foundry. I'm aware some players may not wish to learn about this thing they're unfamiliar with, but I'm not interested in paying $10 a month for features that I'm getting for free using my preferred virtual tabletop. It's easy enough to figure out if you've used Roll20 anyway.</p>
