            <p>For now I've included the rules to come to mind, but this page is liable to change during our session 0. Session 0 is normally where we discuss boundaries and other things that need to be talked about before playing.</p>

            <h1>Basic Rules</h1>
            <p>Please try to keep the following in mind to help everyone have a good time.</p>
            <p><b>Be considerate of other people: </b>While playing, try to be conscientious of other people playing the game. Think twice about killing the important quest NPC(or ask the party!), try not to talk over others, and anything else this entails.</p>
            <p><b>The GM isn't your enemy: </b>The GM may control your enemies, but this isn't a game of GM vs players. Think of the GM as a referee who makes calls based on the roll of the dice and what she thinks your enemies would do.</p>
            <p><b>Don't hesitate to ask questions: </b>Even the most experienced players are bound to feel a bit lost within a homebrew setting, so don't hesitate to ask questions. The GM is here to help.</p>

            <h1>House Rules</h1>
            <p>These are things I'm either changing from base D&D or rules I felt are worth clarifying.</p>
            <p><b>Goodberry enchants berries: </b>Goodberry has been changed so that instead of conjuring berries from nowhere, you instead enchant up to 10 berries. In order to find some, a survival check will need to be made.</p>
            <p><b>PVP is consensual: </b>If a player attempts to steal from another player, the victim player decides if they're successful. They may choose to ask them to make a sleight of hand check... or they can say they're immediately caught.</p>
            <p><b>Help action requires proficiency: </b>In order to use the help action, you need to have proficiency in that skill.</p>
            <p><b>Stealth rolls are group checks: </b>When multiple people are trying to be stealthy, success is determined by majority. If half or more of the party succeeds, then everyone succeeds.</p>
