            <p>If you haven't already, I'd like to point you towards the <a href="precampaign.php">precampaign info</a>. This is meant to help set expectations, so that you know what to expect from a game I run. Once you've got an idea of where you'll be starting, I'd like to point people towards <a href="chargen5e.php">building your character</a>.</p>
            <!-- Campaign: Seishun -->
            <h1>Welcome to Esalona</h1>
            <p>For reasons known only to yourself, you're in the city of Esalona on the continent of <a href="world.php">Seishun</a>. Depending on where you're from, you may feel out of place amongst all the fine robes and streets so clean it almost feels like a crime to walk on them.</p> 
            <p>Yet anyone who's stepped foot outside the great walls surrounding it knows even a city like this has its problems. Most of Seishun is a harsh, untamed wilderness where strange forces have been known to swallow settlements whole and many who step foot outside never return. For this reason the lot of an adventurer is a dangerous one, but also one both sorely needed and well rewarded.</p>
            <!-- <p><b>Joining The Party</b></p>
            <p>At some point, you joined up with a party of adventurers in Esalona and are getting ready to accept your first job. We'll want to discuss how this party formed and where you'd be searching for a job.</p> -->
            <!-- <p>At some point you received an offer from a noble named Telressen asking that you meet with him for details about a job. Whether you received a letter from Telressen himself, found out about it through the Heroes Guild, or learned of the job somewhere else altogether, you don't know much about the job you're taking. What you do know is that there's a promised reward of 10 platinum pieces and future jobs should you handle this one well.</p> -->
            
            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>Regardless of where you came from, you've likely noticed rooms tend to be lit by small contained fires and other objects that naturally emit light. Traveling merchants go from place to place in horse drawn carriages, which are almost always guarded by a group of skilled mercenaries or bodyguards. </p>
            <p>Yet while this is a world of swords and magic, most people have heard of the magitech guns from Drechen. These weapons tend to be very expensive due to their rare, exotic nature and you're unlikely to find someone capable of working with them in Seishun.</p>
            <p>It is worth noting that magitech is illegal in Akalush, but you're unlikely to run into problems for using it in Seishun.</p>

            <!-- <h2>Government</h2>
            <p>You've no doubt noticed that the people of Esalona are governed by The Mithral Society, a group both spearheaded and funded by some of the wealthiest people in Esalona. Members of the group ultimately decide who joins, however, and even vast wealth doesn't necessarily indicate membership.</p> -->

            <h2>Places of Note</h2>
            <p>As an adventurer, there are a few places you're likely already aware of.</p>
            <p><b>The Heroes Guild: </b>Their primary purpose is to act as a go between for adventurers and their clients, though they also try to keep adventurers informed of known dangers outside the city.</p>
            <p><b>Greensong Tavern: </b>A large, popular tavern that's hard to miss if you've been in the city long enough. Not a bad place to gather information or grab a room for a night.</p>
            <p><b>Temple of Truth: </b>A temple dedicated to <a href="religions.php">Nessthiss</a>. Because it attracts a lot of scholarly types hoping to learn the secrets of the world, it's not unusual for them to hire adventurers.</p>
            
            <!-- One shot: Fall of Seldora -->
            <!-- <h1 class="sectionHeader">Campaign Info</h1>
            <p>I'm currently planning to run a oneshot in this world, so setting the website up for that. Expect to see something different whenever I do get a full campaign ready.</p>
            <h2>The Fall of Seldora</h2>
            <p>You were sitting in a tavern in the city of Seldora when the chaos began. First came the warhorns blaring through the city, casting an ominous silence over the normally lively tavern. Then came the screaming and the sound of steel clanging against steel, of people dying, children crying, and strange guttural screams unlike that of any elf.</p>
            <p>By the time those in the tavern had prepared themselves for the battle, the city was already lost. If you’re to survive, then there’s only one option: <b>escape</b>.</p>
            <h3>Session Notes</h3>
            <p>Since this is one and done, I thought it'd be fun to crank up the difficulty and make it so there's a very good chance that not everyone will survive. You're a novice adventurer trapped in a city that has fallen to the enemy, after all, so the odds are not in your favor.</p>
            <p>Due to the higher risk of character death, I'd like to implement a house rule:</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>In most circumstances, your character can sacrifice themselves to save others in the party. Maybe they distract a platoon of enemy soldiers, giving the party a chance to escape, or maybe you shove a party member out of the way in time to take the killing blow instead. Regardless, you will at least have the chance to say something before you die.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Due to this, I'd recommend not worrying too much about your character's backstory.</p> -->
