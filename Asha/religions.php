            <h2>Western Spiritualism</h2>
            <p>Western Spiritualism - often just called Spiritualism in Seishun - is the belief that spirits inhabit all things found naturally in nature. While some spiritualists worship a specific spirit, most revere nature itself and view it as sacred. While not commonly practiced outside of Seishun, but is the majority religion there.</p>
            <p>Because of how spiritualists practice their faith, it's unusual for them to have a central place of worship. Instead they've built shrines to venerate the spirits, which the people of Seishun are known to leave offerings at.</p>

            <h2>Nessthiss</h2>
            <p>Often referred to as the Lady of Dreams, Nessthiss represents secret knowledge and is often associated with white snakes. The religion has spread across all of Asha thanks to the Oracle's of Nessthiss, who experience strange dreams of her. While she's said to rarely speak, it's said that she always imparts some great truth when she does.</p>
            <p>The way she's worshipped varies wildly from place to place, but they all tend to gather around an Oracle of Nessthiss in the hope of being granted a great truth by the Lady of Dreams.</p>

            <h2>The Celestial Emperor</h2>
            <p>The Celestial Emperor is often depicted as a sword gleaming with radiant light. The most common order serving him is the Order of Light, whose goal is to vanquish devils, enslave the human race, and guide people onto what they believe to be the proper path. </p>
            <p>He's said to rule over the Empire of Light by his followers, but those outside of this religion tend to be skeptical of this claim.</p>
            
            <h2>Ekmire</h2>
            <p>Also called the Under Prince, Ekmire is a deity said to represent devils and the things which lurk in the dark. His benevolent worshipers tend to think of him as a misunderstood god fighting against celestial tyranny, while his less benevolent ones claim devils are the rightful rulers of Asha. For these reasons, he is rarely openly worshiped outside of Drechen and even there his followers are treated with suspicion.</p>
            <p>Within the Order of Light, Ekmire is often depicted as a creature of darkness to be slain.</p>

            <h2>The Sacred Craftsmen</h2>
            <p>Often considered dwarvish deities, the Sacred Craftsmen refers to three gods said to hold dominion over mountains in Drechen and the metals within. They are legendary craftsmen as much as they are gods, who are responsible for superbly crafted items of unknown make.</p>
            <p>When a volcano erupts it is said to be the work of Thierna, lighting the forge for one of her creations. When the earth rumbles, it is the work of Adamant transforming iron into the sacred metal that shares his name. When a blacksmith finishes a work unlike any other, he can thank Leabhar the guide for blessing him in his craft.</p>
